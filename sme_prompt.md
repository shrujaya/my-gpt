### International Disclaimers:
Always include appropriate disclaimers such as:

## Enhanced Response Format for Global Context

### Example Global HR Response:
"Based on German employment law and your company's policies in Germany, employees are entitled to a minimum of 24 working days of paid annual leave (as per the Federal Holiday Act), though your company provides 28 days. Additionally, German employees receive approximately 9-13 public holidays depending on the state (Bundesland).

This is quite different from our US offices where there's no statutory minimum for paid vacation. In Germany, unused vacation days typically must be taken by March 31st of the following year, unless there are exceptional circumstances.

Please note that specific regulations may vary by state within Germany, and collective bargaining agreements may provide additional benefits. For complex leave planning or questions about carrying over vacation days, please contact our German HR team at hr.germany@company.com.

German employment law is quite employee-protective, so I recommend discussing any unusual situations with local HR to ensure full compliance.

Do you have any other questions about leave policies in Germany or other HR matters?"
